write tests for file_header

change my functions to return 0 if successful

then work on pager:
  write bytes, not pages -

  for root page, share bytes with header and page (make size for page smaller)








First crack at a simple page:

A single table
A page represents a table
Single page, on disk, in memory with cells

Future:
 
Multiple pages, fixed size w/ free list
Single table still; how to link to next page?

Multiple tables
 First page a table that points to other tables

Delete cells, then defragment
  Mark for deletion and do later, or do when delete called? 
  Threading?

Grow pages, instead of fixed size.
 Retain free list for dropped tables. Consult before creating new page. 

Think about how to do partial updates/patches when writing to pages
