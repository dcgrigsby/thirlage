First crack at a simple page:

A single table
A page represents a table
Single page, on disk, in memory with cells

Future:
 
Multiple pages, fixed size w/ free list
Single table still; how to link to next page?

Multiple tables
 First page a table that points to other tables

Delete cells, then defragment

Grow pages, instead of fixed size.
 Retain free list for dropped tables. Consult before creating new page. 

Think about how to do partial updates/patches when writing to pages
