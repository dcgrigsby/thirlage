work on pager:
  write bytes, not pages -

when to add caching?  when to add free list?

transactions





First crack at a simple page:

A single table
Single page, on disk, in memory with cells

Future:

Multiple tables
 First page a table that points to other tables

Change to cell mark for deletion and do later?

Think about how to do partial updates/patches when writing to pages
